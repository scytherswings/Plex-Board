What is Plex-Board? Put simply, it is a dynamic dashboard for checking the status of multiple services related to Plex Media Server (Plex, Couchpotato, Sickrage, Deluge, Sabnzbd+, etc.).

This is essentially a revamp of a cool project ([Network-Status-Page](https://github.com/scytherswings/Network-Status-Page)) I forked a little while ago.

Pronounced "Plex Dashboard" like that ghetto name [La-a][] (La Dash A)... sorry...

[La-a]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=la-a


Just for clarification, yes this is _another_ Plex dashboard, but this project is _different_ and I'll tell you why.

PlexWatchWeb and the newer (and very cool) PlexPy projects are oriented more towards statistics etc.
Plex-Board is meant to help the users **and** administrators of a Plex server get a quick overview on the status of the various services related to and including Plex itself.
There's a large list of features I plan to support in the future and I take all requests into consideration. If there is something you'd like to see, feel free to chat about it on Gitter, or create a feature request ticket.

## System Requirements

You should have enough space to allow logs and an image cache, so I wouldn't recommend using on a system with less than 1GB free HDD space.

Rails can probably run on 512MB of RAM fine and CPU usage will vary. You can probably get away with a single core, but dual core may run smoother.


## Install Instructions
##### Development branch status:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scytherswings/Plex-Board.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/scytherswings/Plex-Board)

### This project is not ready for real production use yet, so don't expect stability until a 1.0.0 release

These instructions have been tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 using bash as of 10/16/2015.
Other operating systems will probably work, but for now I'm only going to write instructions for Ubuntu.

1. `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install git bundler nodejs curl -y;`

2.      gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3;
        curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails


3. `source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm`

3. `cd /opt` Now at this point, you might have to give your user write permissions to this directory. If that is the case run `sudo chmod 755 /opt -R`

4. `git clone https://github.com/scytherswings/Plex-Board.git`

5. `rvm use 2.3.0@plexdashboard --create` If you get a message saying something like: `RVM is not a function, selecting rubies with 'rvm use ...' will not work.` 
Then you'll have to run `/bin/bash --login` or reboot with `sudo reboot`. If you get an error saying that the gemset already
exists then you can omit `--create`.

6. `cd /opt/Plex-Board`

7. `rvm use 2.3.0@plexdashboard`

8. `./serverSetup.sh`

9. `./runServer.sh` Note that the server will stop running if you kill this process (like if you exit out of an SSH session etc.)
You could keep it running if you start it in a screen session.

Remember, this is for _testing._


### Feedback
If you run into any bugs, please, make a ticket or ask in the Gitter chat room. 
I'm sure I'll miss something in my testing so feel free to let me know what I overlooked. 
Since I work on this project in my free time, I can't always respond to chats immediately but I'll do the best I can to get back to you within the day.
